Celesto AI is the developer-first platform to deploy long-running AI agents and MCP servers with built-in observability. We let developers build AI agents without worrying about runtime infrastructure, security, durability, or observability.

## What We Build

**Build. Scale. AI Agents in minutes.**

Celesto provides the fastest way to deploy long-running AI agents with:

- **Agent Runtime Infrastructure** — Deploy agents that run for hours or days, not just seconds. Handle complex, multi-step workflows without timeout limits.
- **Built-in Observability** — Every agent execution is automatically traced. Debug complex workflows, inspect tool calls, and optimize performance without writing a single log line.
- **Enterprise Security** — Agent authentication with scoped API keys, per-tenant sandboxes, TLS 1.2+ encryption in transit, and AES-256 at rest.
- **MCP Server Hosting** — Deploy and manage Model Context Protocol servers alongside your agents.

## Why Celesto?

Traditional serverless platforms weren't built for AI agents. They have timeout limits, lack agent-specific tooling, and require you to build observability from scratch.

Celesto is purpose-built for the AI agent era:

- **Zero Config Tracing** — Automatic tracing built into every agent call
- **Live Streaming** — Watch traces stream in real-time as agents run in production
- **Data Ownership** — You fully own your data. Export on demand and control retention policies
- **One-click Management** — Manage documents, conversations, and connectors directly from the dashboard
